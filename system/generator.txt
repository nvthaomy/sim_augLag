To create a CG representation from an Amber
>>generator.CreateCG('Prefix')

This will walk through the creation process, and at the end create the files described below:

Prefix.mapfile
contains a dictionary with keys for each amino-acid type that has been coarse-grained.  The corresponding values contain information about CG model topology and mapping

Prefix_generatorCG.txt
This file contains the system sitelist, bondlist, ambermapping, and other information that results when the mapfile is applied to the Amber input files

Prefix_md.py
This is a sim package script file that builds the CG system.

To create a Sys object from a previously defined CG mapping
>>Sys=generator.ReadGenerator('Prefix').MakeSysObject()

If you hand edit an already existing mapfile, then run
>>generator.CreateCG('Prefix')
it will bypass having to re-input everything and just create the above files based off of the already existing mapfile. For example, if you make a mapfile for one system say the solvated 12 FF system, then you can use that same mapfile to create a generator file and md.py file for another system.  As long as they have all the same amino acid and molecule types.
